* [Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4566)
* [Datasheet](./AHT20-datasheet-2020-4-16.pdf)

## Pinout

The AHT20 sensor is connected to the Rasperry Pi via the following pins:

Pin # | Pin Name | Connection
:-:|:-:|:-:
1 | 3.3v | Voltage in
3 | GPIO2 | I2C SDA
5 | GPIO3 | I2C SDL
9 | GND | Ground

## Pre-requistes

* Raspberry Pi, but could run elsewhere
* On the machine: `python3-smbus` installed
* On Python: `smbus2` installed

## Notes

* The I2C bus is fixed to `1`, as it's the default one for the Raspberry Pi.
